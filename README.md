# TTS-Rapid-Deck-Builder
A tool to quickly create and iterate on decks for use within Tabletop Simulator.

Quickly iterating on cards is not easy when the image that is to be fed into Tabletop Simulator needs to be in a particular format, leading to clunky setups in graphics processing programs. This tool aims to resolve that.

Current features:
- Project structure which can be shared with others
- Choice of rectangular and square cards, both in high and low res
- Card preview while editing
- Quick upload to Imgur for fast import to TTS
- Customizable deck variables:
  - Font
  - Background
  - Outline size
